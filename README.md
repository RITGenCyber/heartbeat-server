# heartbeat-server
The server for the heartbeat sensor used by Metropolis General hospital.

The configuration file config.txt must be modified before the server will start.
Simply put the IP address you would like the server to listen on in place of the
<server-ip> parameter. The server must run as root if the default port of 445 is
used, as this is a well-known port.
